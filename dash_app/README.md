# Deploy Dash with GCP

This repository contains two simple dash applications that can be deployed with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

1. The first is one that reads in a locally-stored file in `data` folder and creates a graph from adding and multiplying the numbers in `data.csv`. This can be found in the `/simple-dash-app-engine-app` folder, including a [README](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/deploy-dash-with-gcp/blob/master/simple-dash-app-engine-app/README.md) guide. 
2. The second is an example whereby we link the app to a GCP bucket containing the data. This can be found in the `/simple-dash-app-using-a-bucket` folder. This also has a [README](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/deploy-dash-with-gcp/blob/master/simple-dash-app-using-a-bucket/README.md) guide.

More training materials can be found on our [GitHub pages training page](https://datasciencecampus.github.io/training/).

To run these examples, clone this repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/datasciencecampus/deploy-dash-with-gcp.git
```
